# haveFunWithDB2

This project proposes some SQL tips and techniques to have fun with the DB2 databases.
Some tehchiques have been tested on different versions of DB2, principally :

- DB2 Express C (free version of DB2 LUW), version 11.1 minimum
- DB2 for i (embedded version in IBM i servers), V7R2 minimum

I don't have the opportunity to test the queries on DB2 for Z/OS, so if someone wants do it and report the result, I will be very interested.

Sometimes, there are some small differences of implementation between the different versions of DB2, differences that require adaptations of the SQL code. When that happens, find a workaround is an interesting exercise.

For the tips which render in ASCII Art style, use a non-proportional font to display the output correctly.

List of tips :

- tip01 : draw the Mandelbrot Set in ASCII Art style
- tip02 : SQL 3d engine in ASCII Art style
